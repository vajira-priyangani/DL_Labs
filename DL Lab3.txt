In the given example, the 1D convolution is applied to the signal using a filter that detects edges. 
The filter has a pattern of [-1, 1], which effectively responds to transitions from high to low intensity in the signal. 
As the convolution operation slides the filter along the signal, it computes the difference between neighboring values, 
effectively highlighting the points where there is a significant change in intensity. This result visually emphasizes the edges or transitions within the signal.
